Using the given files as a starting point, please create a directive that will display the progress to goal for an employee's sales in a given month. After you have created the directive, use it to display the employee's avatar, name and progress bar on the page. A mockup has been included in the assets/images/ directory as a reference for styling.  Feel free to introduce improvements to the style, such as rounded corners on avatars, padding adjustments, etc.

- Please allot a *maximum* of 4 hours to complete this task
- You are free to use any tools you have at your disposal.
- Angular and Bootstrap have already been included in your index.html file.
- We have created a factory to mock api consumption. You will not need to alter this service to complete the exercise.
- The incoming data will have the following structure:
{
  "revenue_performances": array
  [{
    "id": integer
    "type": string
    "owner": {
      "id": integer
      "name": string
      "first_name": string
      "last_name": string
      "avatar": string
      "type": string
      "team_id": integer
    }
    "date": date
    "notes": string
    "revenue_target": float
    "revenue_actual": float
    "last_edited_by": {
      "id": integer
      "first_name": string
      "last_name": string
    }
    "last_edited_at": datetime
  }]
}

- There are four items in the "revenue_performances" array.
- You will need to calculate the expected progress based on the current day of the month and the overall target for the month. 
- The progress bar should display red if the employee is below their expected progress, and green if they are at or above their expected progress.

BONUS TASK: Wow us with whiz-bang
We understand that too much animation can be a distraction.  However, we strive to make our apps engaging, rewarding, and ultimately something our internal and external clients love to use.  Put your flare on the directive by introducing tasteful user interactions (e.g. fading-in, a growing progress bar, numbers that count up, the ability to swipe from one employee to the next).  We leave it up to your discretion to strike the right balance.
